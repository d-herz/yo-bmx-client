      <h1>Welcome to YO! BMX</h1>

      <h2>Life Behind Bars</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Made by BMX riders for BMX riders.</strong> 
        Our main goal here is to provide an inclusive and positive place where BMXers can come together, hang out, and talk about BMX. The forum has several rules in place in order to facilitate this mission, and they can be viewed here. We ask all visitors to adhere to these rules. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Furthermore, we believe in giving back to and supporting the BMX scene and industry as much as possible. Please support your LBS and favorite BMX companies as much as possible. Here's a list of a few of our favorites: (S&M, ODYSSEY, KINK, etc)
      </p>

      <p>Oh, and be sure to stop by our Discord as well! </p>
